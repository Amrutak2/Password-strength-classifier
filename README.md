# Pokemon

Hi, as a screen to assess, we at Web Cannon-Z Fullstack Internship Team, request you to create a simple app. please visit Pokeapi, and get information about Pok√©mon, collect its stats and attacks and display them in a responsive card using ReactJs. Finally host the work on Netlify. Share the URL and the github repo links.

Not yet done Sir/Mam, I was confused what to do as it was return an online test. I will be finishing it soon.
