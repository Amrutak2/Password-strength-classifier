Hi, as a screen to assess, we at Web Cannon-Z Fullstack Internship Team, request you to create a simple app. please visit Pokeapi, and get information about Pokémon, collect its stats and attacks and display them in a responsive card using ReactJs. Finally host the work on Netlify. Share the URL and the github repo links.
